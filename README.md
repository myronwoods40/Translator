# Translator

The code underneath uses JSON to crawl Google translate. The code then translates English to Spanish, French, and German.  The languages translated can easily be changed by editing lines 129-131. These lines use language codes to send to the API. For instance, the code for German is “de”. These abbreviations can easily be found online. The rest of the code is just JavaFX to create a user interface in which a user can execute a translation.
